# Predictive risk modelling with statistical and machine learning

In this task, we are interested in exploring machine learning approaches to predict the burned area of bushfires by using meteorological data that are known to influence the wild fires. The dataset that we are going to use here were originally collected from the northeast region of Portugal between January 2000 and December 2003. It contains geographical information, fire weather indices, and the corresponding weather conditions. The aim is to build statistical models that can predict the burned area of the bushfires.

The dataset contains 517 fire instances, each of which have 13 columns: the first 12 columns corresponding to the attributes (e.g., spatial coordinates, month, day, four fire indices, and other meteorological data) and the last column containing the burned area, i.e., the variable that we will predict.
